# Fantasy League Prediction Tool

## Project Overview
A tool to analyze fantasy league data and predict player performance for upcoming seasons using historical data and advanced analytics.

## Tech Stack

### Data Collection & Processing
- **Python** with the following libraries:
  - `pandas` - For data manipulation and analysis
  - `numpy` - For numerical computations
  - `scikit-learn` - For machine learning models
  - `requests` - For API calls to fetch league data

### Machine Learning Components
- **Prediction Models**:
  - Linear Regression for basic projections
  - Random Forest for complex pattern recognition
  - XGBoost for improved accuracy
  - Time Series Analysis for trend prediction

### Backend
- **FastAPI** or **Flask** for REST API endpoints
- **PostgreSQL** for storing historical data and predictions
- **Redis** (optional) for caching frequently accessed data

### Frontend
- Continue with your existing frontend setup
- Add visualization libraries:
  - `Chart.js` or `D3.js` for interactive data visualization
  - `react-table` for displaying player stats

## Features to Implement
1. Historical Data Analysis

2. Prediction Models
   - Season-long performance predictions
   - Weekly matchup projections
   - Player comparison tools

3. Probability Calculations
   - Win/loss probability for matchups
   - Player boom/bust potential
   - Confidence intervals for predictions
